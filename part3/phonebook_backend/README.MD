This repository contains the fullstack of a phonebook application. Users can add new contacts to the phonebook, delete existing contacts, or update existing contacts. Contacts can also be filtered with a filter input. Contacts are saved to MongoDB.

I followed FullStackOpens' instructions for writing this application (courses: part 2 and part 3).

The application has been deployed at https://phonebook-backend-quiet-bush-1747.fly.dev/.
